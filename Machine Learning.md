# Statistical Learning and Model Applications: From Linear Regression to Tree-Based Models

## Statistical Learning and Model Accuracy Evaluation

### Model Evaluation Methods
In statistical learning, evaluating the accuracy of a model is crucial. We use the following datasets to assess model performance:
- **Training Data**: Used to fit the model.
- **Validation Data**: Used for parameter tuning and model selection.
- **Test Data**: Used to evaluate the final model's generalization performance.

### Methods for Evaluating Model Accuracy
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Used for regression models to measure the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Accuracy**: Used for classification models to measure the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a detailed description of a classification model's performance, including TP, FP, TN, FN.
- **AUC-ROC**: Evaluates the overall performance of a classification model, especially in cases of imbalanced samples.

### Applications of Statistical Learning in Data Analysis and Prediction
Statistical learning has widespread applications in data analysis and prediction, including but not limited to:
- Market Analysis
- Medical Diagnosis
- Risk Management
- Customer Behavior Prediction

## Linear Model Selection and Regularization

### Ridge and Lasso Regression
Regularization techniques play a critical role in preventing overfitting. We will explore two commonly used regularization methods:
- **Ridge Regression**: Adds a penalty term \( \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j^2 \) to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients.
- **Lasso Regression**: Adds a penalty term \( \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j| \) to perform variable selection.
